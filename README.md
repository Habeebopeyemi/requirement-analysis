# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction

This repository explores the foundational phase of **Requirement Analysis** in software development. It aims to document, illustrate, and explain how clear, well-structured requirements contribute to building reliable, scalable, and user-centered software systems.

Whether you're a developer, project manager, or stakeholder, understanding this process is essential for aligning expectations, reducing development risks, and ensuring successful project outcomes.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

### 🧠 Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

- **Clarity and Understanding**: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition**:  Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- **Basis for Design and Development**: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
